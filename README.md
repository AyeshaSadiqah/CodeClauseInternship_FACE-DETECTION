# CodeClauseInternship_FACE-DETECTION


This repo contains Python code for face detection using OpenCV and Pillow.
It uses a pre-trained Haar cascade model to detect faces in images and video frames.
The code is simple to understand and use, and it can be easily modified to detect faces in different lighting conditions and with different facial expressions.
